# âš½ FIFA World Cup Analysis (1930â€“2022)

## Overview

Every four years, the FIFA World Cup captivates billions. But while the excitement is global, the **analysis of its historical performance data is fragmented, raw, and difficult to interpret**. 

This project aims to centralize and decode 90+ years of World Cup data using **SQL for backend logic** and **Power BI for storytelling**, producing an intuitive, insights-rich dashboard.

## Business Problem

Despite the immense data generated across decades of FIFA World Cups, stakeholders (teams, managers, analysts, and fans) struggle with:

- Understanding team performance across tournaments  
- Visualizing ranking trends over time  
- Measuring attendance and fan engagement patterns  
- Evaluating the role of leadership and home advantage  
- Identifying consistent top performers and close matches  

Thereâ€™s a clear **gap between raw data and actionable insight**.

## Objectives

This project solves those gaps by:

-  Cleaning and transforming World Cup match data from 1930 to 2022  
-  Using **SQL queries** to extract meaningful insights (CTEs, window functions, joins)  
-  Creating an **interactive Power BI dashboard** to visualize trends and comparisons  
-  Delivering real answers to real analytical questions
