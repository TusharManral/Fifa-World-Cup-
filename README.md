⚽ #FIFA World Cup Analysis (1930 – 2022)

**Overview**

The FIFA World Cup is not only the most prestigious tournament in football but also one of the most watched sporting events globally. However, despite its popularity, historical data analysis remains underutilized. Coaches, analysts, and federations often struggle to uncover deep insights across decades of tournaments due to fragmented datasets and lack of visual context.

To solve this, we designed a robust Power BI Dashboard powered by SQL and structured data modeling — providing a unified view of match outcomes, goal scoring trends, team performance, FIFA rankings, and audience engagement.

📊 Explore over 90 years of World Cup legacy — all in one interactive dashboard.

**🎯 Business Problem**

Despite the rich history of the FIFA World Cup, stakeholders like analysts, teams, fans, and journalists face several pain points:
	•	❌ No centralized view of historical performance
	•	❌ Inconsistent FIFA ranking comparisons over time
	•	❌ Difficulty analyzing attendance and engagement trends
	•	❌ Inability to identify patterns in team dominance or scoring trends

This project solves these challenges by creating a comprehensive analytical dashboard powered by clean, joined, and modeled datasets.

**🔎 SQL Query Use Cases**
Although not shown on the dashboard directly, SQL was used heavily in preprocessing:
	•	Ranking teams using window functions
	•	Aggregating top scorers and match appearances
	•	Identifying penalty-based finals, close matches, and home dominance
	•	Cleaning ASCII issues and unifying country names across datasets

(You can find full SQL queries in the /sql_queries folder of the GitHub repository.)
