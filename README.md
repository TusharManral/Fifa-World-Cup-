# FIFA World Cup Analysis (1930–2022) — Power BI & SQL Project

-- 
🧠 **Project Overview**

The FIFA World Cup is one of the most globally recognized sporting events. However, the sheer volume of historical data often makes it difficult to derive actionable insights for fans, analysts, broadcasters, and even team strategists.

This project aims to solve that problem by designing a Power BI dashboard powered by SQL-prepared data to provide a comprehensive, interactive, and insightful view of World Cup trends, team performances, player achievements, and fan engagement.

	•	How have FIFA rankings changed over time and what patterns exist in point fluctuations?
	•	Which players have left a legacy in terms of goals?
	•	What is the trend in match frequency and fan attendance?
	•	Which hosts attracted the most attention?
